# Meeting-maps

Uses the Google maps api to create a single page application that shows whatever meetings and events you have in mysql.  Right now this project consists of 3 pages- the front end that use js, html, css and jquery.  A webservice page written in PHP.  A backend, I'm including the script to create the database.  This project is done, but alot more features could be added.  Depending on your point of view it could be a .1 release or 1.
